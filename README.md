# 👋 Hi, I'm Stefi

🎓 Third-year Computer Engineering student @ UTCN
🔬 Undergraduate Researcher @ Imperial College | Working Student @ NTT DATA
💻 Passionate about systems programming, software engineering, and tech-driven problem-solving

I love building things at the intersection of code and logic, especially when they involve systems, concurrency, or embedded design. I also enjoy leading impactful student events and exploring technical challenges beyond the classroom.
